I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/).

I'm broadly interested in statistics and machine learning. In particular, I currently focus on alignment for language models, multiple testing, and causal inference. I'm currently working with Professor [Jingshu Wang](https://jingshuw.org/) on statistical inference problems and Professor [Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/) on large language models fine tuning for alignment.
 
Previously, I received my master's degree in statistics at the University of Chicago. Prior to UChicago, I was an undergraduate student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
